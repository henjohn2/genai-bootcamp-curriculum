# README for Fine-Tuning and Using Language Models with PEFT, BnB, and RAG

This README provides an overview of the processes involved in fine-tuning language models using Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and Bits and Bytes (BnB), and utilizing the fine-tuned models in a Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) setup as implemented in the scripts `instruct_train_qlora.py` and `rag_qlora.py`. Accompanying Jupyter notebooks provide a step-by-step breakdown of these scripts, guiding users through fine-tuning a large pre-trained language model on specific datasets and leveraging it for query answering through the RAG framework.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is divided into two main scripts, each paired with a detailed Jupyter notebook that mirrors the script’s functionality:

1. **`instruct_train_qlora.py`**: Fine-tunes a language model on a specific dataset for tasks like question answering using PEFT and BnB.
2. **`rag_qlora.py`**: Utilizes the fine-tuned model in a RAG setup to generate answers based on content retrieved from a vectorized database.

## Detailed Steps

### For `instruct_train_qlora.py`:

#### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
- Load and filter a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub based on specified criteria.
- Format the data to structure context, instruction, and response for training.

#### Step 2: Model Setup
- Configure the model with PEFT and BnB for efficient parameter updates and reduced memory usage.

#### Step 3: Training Process
- Set training parameters like batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc.
- Train the model using efficient methods such as gradient accumulation and checkpointing.

#### Step 4: Model Saving
- Save the trained model for inference or further fine-tuning.

### For `rag_qlora.py`:

#### Step 1: Model and Tokenizer Setup
- Load the PEFT model along with its tokenizer.

#### Step 2: Text Generation
- Configure the model to generate text based on a given prompt, adjusting parameters like temperature for sampling.

#### Step 3: Database Integration
- Set up a PGVector database connection and configure an embedding function for storing and retrieving document embeddings.

#### Step 4: Generate Response
- Use the RAG prompt template to formulate queries and generate contextually relevant responses based on retrieved documents.

## Usage

To use these pipelines, follow these steps:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Configure the scripts with the correct model IDs and dataset.
3. Execute each script or navigate through the notebook to perform the fine-tuning and query generation processes.

## Script and Command-Line Interface

Here’s how to use the scripts from the command line:

For `instruct_train_qlora.py`:

```bash
python instruct_train_qlora.py
```

For `rag_qlora.py`:

```bash
python rag_qlora.py
```

## Conclusion

This setup provides a comprehensive method for training and utilizing large language models for complex tasks requiring nuanced understanding and specific knowledge. The integration of PEFT and BnB ensures efficient training, while the RAG framework leverages the fine-tuned models to deliver contextually accurate responses based on dynamic queries. This approach is scalable and suitable for educational purposes as well as real-world applications. The accompanying Jupyter notebooks offer a detailed, interactive exploration of the processes outlined in the scripts, ideal for learning and experimentation.
